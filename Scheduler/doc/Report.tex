\section{Description of the simulator}
In this section a brief analysis of the code and other technical aspect of the simulator will be discussed.
\subsection{Events}
The simulator is designed to manage a range of events within this system, with a particular focus on two crucial types: the arrival of a client and the departure. Each event type has a distinct impact on the simulator's state, influenced by the specific target under consideration.
\subsubsection{Delay station}

\textbf{Departure from the delay station}: a departure from the delay station will cause an arrival at the swap-in station.
Arrival at the delay station: an arrival will trigger a departure with a certain delay, that is a Random Variable with a negative exponential distribution of 5000 ms.

\textbf{Arrival at the delay station}:

\subsubsection{Reserve station}
Arrival at the Reserve station: if the counter of the process allocated in the system is less than the MPD. Then the  arrival event is immediately scheduled for the swap in. Otherwise, the information are stored in a queue for later use at the next arrival.

\subsubsection{Swap in}
Arrival at the swap in station: an arrival to this station will trigger a departure with a delay, equal to a RV with negative exponential distribution of 210 ms. If at the arrival the station is `occupied' by another client that is waiting it's departure, then the client will be served later with an FCFS policy.

Departure from the swap in station: a departure from the swap in will trigger an immediate arrival at the CPU.

\subsubsection{CPU}
\textbf{Arrival at the CPU}: when a process arrives at the CPU a service time based on a hyper exponential distribution is assigned and then 2 things can happen. 1) The CPU is not busy, then the current process will occupy the CPU and a departure will be scheduled for a time equivalent to the actual clock + time slice, the same time will be decreased from the remaining service time of the process. 2) The CPU is busy, then the process will be enqueued in the process queue.

\textbf{Departure from the CPU}: A process can leave the CPU only when its service time is 0. So when a departure is scheduled 2 case exists: 1) The process's service time is > 0, in this case the process is enqueued again in the process queue. 2) The process's service time is 0, in this case the next station will be randomly chosen (using proper probabilities) and the event will be scheduled as arrival for that station. If there is a process in the queue, after those operations, it will be dequeued and processed by the CPU using the same mechanism described for the arrivals.

\subsubsection{IO}

Arrival to IO1/IO2: in both cases an arrival will trigger a departure from the relative station that is an RV with negative exponential distribution.

Departure from IO1/IO2: in both cases this will result in an immediate arrival event to the CPU.

\subsubsection{Swap Out}
Arrival to swap out: this event will trigger an immediate departure for the swap out

Departure from swap out: this event will trigger an immediate arrival to the delay station with p 0.4 or an immediate arrival to the reserve station with p 0.6. In any case this event will decrement by 1 the counter of allocated process in the reserve station.


\subsection{Choice of the regeneration point}

\section{First validation step}
\subsection{Bottleneck analysis}
In order to start the analysis , let's show here the simplified model
used to conduct the validation.
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Images/simplified_model.png}
\\And summarize some data:
\begin{displaymath}
    \begin{aligned}
        S_2 = 210ms  &  & S_3= 2.7ms     &  & S_4 = 40ms    &  & S_5=180ms      \\
        q_{3,0}= 0.4 &  & q_{3,1}=0.6    &  & q_{3,3} = 0.9 &  & q_{3,4}= 0.065 \\
                     &  & q_{3.5}= 0.025 &  & q_{3,6}=0.01  &  &
    \end{aligned}
\end{displaymath}
Based on this data, it becomes evident that the provided approximation is plausible. Given a process with a 0.9 probability of returning with a mean service time of 2.7, and considering our original model where clients exhibit a mean service time of 27 ms and a fixed CPU slice time of 2.7 ms, we anticipate that a customer will be rescheduled in the CPU nearly nine additional times following the initial scheduling. \\

From the previous data we can extract this matrix
\begin{displaymath}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0     &  & 1     &  & 0   &  & 0     &  & 0     \\
        0     &  & 0     &  & 1   &  & 0     &  & 0     \\
        0.004 &  & 0.006 &  & 0.9 &  & 0.065 &  & 0.025 \\
        0     &  & 0     &  & 1   &  & 0     &  & 0     \\
        0     &  & 0     &  & 1   &  & 0     &  & 0     \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{displaymath}

From which we can extract the following system of equations
\begin{displaymath}
    \begin{cases}
        V_0=0.004V_3           \\
        V_2=V_0+0.006V_3       \\
        V_3=V_2+0.9V_3+V_4+V_5 \\
        V_4=0.065V_3           \\
        V_5= 0.025V_3
    \end{cases}
\end{displaymath}
with the additional equation $V_0=1$. Resolving this system lead to the computation
all $V_i$
\begin{displaymath}
    \begin{cases}
        V_0=1     \\
        V_3=250   \\
        V_2=2.5   \\
        V_4=16.25 \\
        V_5=6.25
    \end{cases}
\end{displaymath}

From this computes $V_i$ is possible to detect which of the station is the bottleneck of the system
by considering that $VbS_b= \max_i\{V_iS_i\}$, so let's compute all $V_iS_i$ and find
the greater one.

\begin{displaymath}
    \begin{aligned}
        V_2S_2= 525ms &  & V_3S_3=675ms &  & V_4S_4=650ms &  & V_5S_5= 1125ms
    \end{aligned}
\end{displaymath}
from this calculation we can say that $V_bS_b=V_5S_5=1125ms$ and so , station 5 (IO2) is
our bottleneck. Let's extract some additional information, as the total cycle time when $N=1$ ,i.e Y(1)
\begin{displaymath}
    D=\sum_{i=1}^{N}D_i=\sum_{i=1}^{N}V_iS_i + V_0S_0=7975ms
\end{displaymath}
Thus we can also calculate the saturation point $N^*$ of this system, after which we can expect
the total response time will increase.
\begin{displaymath}
    N^*=\frac{Y(1)}{V_bS_b}=\frac{D}{V_bS_b}=\frac{7975ms}{1125ms}=7.08
\end{displaymath}
\subsection{MVA analysis}
Starting from the previous matrix is possible to compute various measures using the MVA algorithm for Load Indipendent and Delay stations. In order to compute the visits vector is possible to resolve the matrix Q as system of linear equations $V=VQ$, in this case the solution comes by initializing the vector $V = [1,0,0,0,0]$ and then dot multiply it repeatly for the matrix Q. In python this can be done with the following script :\pagebreak
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
    matrix = np.array([
    [0,1,0,0,0],
    [0,0,1,0,0],
    [0.004,0.006,0.9,0.065,0.025],
    [0,0,1,0,0],
    [0,0,1,0,0]],np.dtype('d'))

    v = np.zeros(len(matrix))
    v[0] = 1
    for i in range(1000):
        v = v @ matrix
        pass
    for i in range(1,len(v)):
        v[i] = v[i]*(1/v[0])
        pass
    v[0] = 1
    \end{lstlisting}
Applying MVA to those values we obtain the subsequent values.

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/Utilizations.png}\\
From the utilization functions we can conclude that the bottleneck station is IO2, as confirmed by the bottleneck analysis. Also becomes evident that after the saturation point ($N \approx7$) the growth of utilization tend to diminish despite the linear increase of N.
\\
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/throughputs.png}
\\
Also from the throughputs the same statement can be reached, but with a particular observation on the CPU, that gradually stop the increasing of the throughput as N becomes larger then 7. This phenomena is similar to a very well known problem in the operative system ecosystem: thrashing. In this case the thrashing is caused by the massive use of the IO2 from the processes involved, so the throughput of the CPU will not decrease but remain steady as it will depend entirely on the process capacity of the IO2.
\\
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/meanWaits.png}
\\
Mean waits also confirm that the bottleneck station is the IO2, since all other don't increase their mean wait time at the increase of N.
\\
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/meanClients.png}
\\
In this graph the tendency of the IO2 station to be a bottleneck is much visible, since the customers tend to increase the queue size of the IO2 at the increase of N.
\\
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/ActiveTimes.png}
\\
Considering the subsystem composed by IO1,IO2 and CPU we can estimate then the active time of a client with little effort, resorting to little's formula
$$
    \bar{w}= \frac{\bar{n}}{\lambda}
$$
since all the clients are coming from the swap in, then it's throughput becomes the arrival rate of the formula. The data show that with N=20 a value of 6630 should be expected.
\section{Simulation results}




\section{Simulator description}
\subsection{Brief description of the implementation}
The simulator is substantially a shell. The program loads at the beginning the skeleton of the simulator composed by an OS object. Such object hold the description of the model composed by a Round Robin station (class CPU), a delay station (class DelayStation) and all the other First Come First Served (class FCFSStation). The OS Object inherit from scheduler that hold the main event queue and manage all the operations inside the simulator. OS also inherit from the class Simulator, that substantially contains all the functions that are need to pilot the execution, such as dequeue an event , route it to the right station and so on. The environment of simulation is divided in 3 abstraction layers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item class SimulationEnvironment
    \item class SimulationResult
    \item class SimulationShell
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{SimulationEnvironment}
This class hold the setup functions for the base system and each scenario. Scenarios are a short way to describe the regeneration point for that scenario and the parameter for the simulation (for example the cpu slice time). In all the four case described the regeneration point is the same, but the parameter (especially for the CPU) are different. This class also contains the SimulationResult data strucuture, which holds all the accumulators.
\subsubsection{SimulationResult}
SimulationResult class hold all the accumulator used to display the result of the simulator, it contains various function for register 2 particular measure of all the station involved: mean waits and mean clients. At the end of each regeneration cycle the measure are extracted from the OS class.
\subsubsection{SimulationShell}
this class hold all the functions need to make the program interactive, in the section Available commands various input can be used to manipulate the simulator. The principal facilities of this class let the user to create a Command structure, which pair a sequence of character to an action.
